**📦 Final Collectibles System – Land of Dragons and Snakes**

---

This system includes symbolic collectibles beyond the main items and armor. These are optional but deepen immersion, reward exploration, and unlock hidden scrolls, endings, or spiritual insights.

---

### 🪞 1. Glyphs of Inversion (12 Total)

- Small glowing markings hidden across scenes
- Only visible with Serpent Vision or Harmonic Crystal from Bellmaker’s Workshop
- Each glyph is an **inverted sacred symbol** (e.g. upside-down cross, twisted triangle, corrupted scripture)

**Collecting all 12:**
- Unlocks scroll: “They reversed the truth… but not the source.”
- Optional bonus: Opens entrance to The Inverted Library (final hidden area)

---

### 🐍 2. Serpent Typology Codex

- When the player frees an NPC, they “record” the serpent in their Codex
- Each serpent added with its:
  - **Sin** (e.g., Pride, Vanity)
  - **Form** (e.g., Floating, Clinging)
  - **Last Words** (final hiss heard before vanishing)

**Codex UI:** Opens from inventory as “Spiritual Bestiary”

**Collecting all types (7):**
- Unlocks scroll: “Each dragon is born of a lie. But none can survive the Word.”

---

### 🔊 3. Echoes of the City (8 Total)

- Audio/visual fragments hidden in ruins or activated with the Echo Pendant from Silent Crypt
- Each echo is a memory from before the fall (e.g. bellmaker singing, mother praying, child drawing)

**Collecting all 8:**
- Unlocks a scene: “The City Before” — a cutscene memory with a full choir and vision of the city intact

---

### 📖 4. Scroll Count (30 Total)

- 15 in Lore Scroll Volume I
- 15 in Volume II
- Some are:
  - Given by NPCs
  - Hidden in puzzle rooms
  - Rewarded for collecting glyphs, echoes, or defeating the King Dragon

**Reading all 30:**
- Unlocks the Final Scroll with hidden line:
  > “And the temple shall be within them.”

---

### 🪙 5. Coin of Deceit Tracking

- If the player keeps or uses the Coin of Deceit, a secret ending is affected
- If it’s thrown away before acquiring the last armor, a blessing appears at the mirror

**Symbolic Meaning:** Can the player reject worldly power before the climax?

---

✅ **Total Completion Bonus**

- If all collectibles are acquired:
  - Scrolls 1–30
  - Glyphs 1–12
  - Echoes 1–8
  - All 7 serpent codex entries
  - Coin of Deceit properly discarded

**Then:** The mirror at the end reflects the player not only in armor — but *transfigured*. Light pulses from within. Text appears:

> “This is what the garden remembered.”
