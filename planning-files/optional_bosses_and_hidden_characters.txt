## 👁️‍🗨️ Hidden Encounter: The Inverted Monk

**Location:** The Cloister of Veils (hidden behind false wall in Ruined Church)

**Visual:** Hooded monk seated before inverted altar. Black fire flickers upward. Wears a twisted rosary.

**Trigger:** Only appears if the player lit the idol candle before redeeming the Mother.

**Dialogue Tree:**

> “So… you lit the false flame. Was it warmth or fear you followed?”

- [Option 1] “I was deceived.”
- [Option 2] “It was my choice.”

> “Good. Both are true.”

> “You wear armor now — but tell me, do you know its weight? Or just its glow?”

**Final Riddle:**
> “When the cross is upside-down… does it point to hell, or simply remind us who died on it?”

> “Truth can be twisted. Logos cannot.”

**Outcome:**
- Player receives Lore Scroll: “The mask of evil is worn with scripture.”
- Player loses 1 scroll temporarily unless they answer “choice” over “deception”
