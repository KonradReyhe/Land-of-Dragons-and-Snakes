**Scene 1: The Mirror Chamber**

---

**Theme:** Self-awareness. The first lie is within.

---

**Setting & Atmosphere:**
- The player awakens alone in a cold, circular stone chamber.
- The room is lit by dim, flickering light coming through a broken stained-glass dome overhead.
- Ancient scripture is carved into the walls, cracked and faded. Words like “truth,” “light,” “Logos” are half-erased.
- A mirror lies shattered across the room. Symbols like the ichthys (fish), cross, triangle, and serpent are embedded in the glass shards.
- There is silence, except for the faint dripping of water.

---

**Visual & Spiritual Tone:**
- Stillness. Tension. A presence of something lost.
- The feeling of potential — like a forgotten sacred place waiting to speak again.

**Puzzle Overview: The Shattered Mirror**
The mirror is the first challenge. It represents the player's fractured spiritual sight and memory.

**Puzzle Steps:**
1. **Exploration** – Player clicks on mirror shards around the room (5 total).
   - Each shard gives a whisper from scripture: e.g. “Now we see dimly…”, “You shall know the truth…”, “Who told you that you were naked?”

2. **Reassembly** – Player drags shards to the mirror frame.
   - Placing all shards in correct order activates a soft hum and flash of light.

3. **Vision Trigger** – Upon completion, a **cutscene** plays:
   - The player sees their own reflection — with a **serpent coiled around their neck**, whispering lies (VO whisper: “You are your own master… You make your own truth… There is no judgment…”)
   - The screen distorts. A voice (Logos) cuts through: **“The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord.”**

4. **Breaking Free** – Player must click on the serpent in the mirror.
   - The reflection reaches out — the real player rips the serpent off.
   - It dissolves into black ash.

---

**Spiritual Outcome:**
- The camera pulls back. The restored mirror now shows light radiating behind the player’s reflection.
- Text fades in: **“Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth…” (Ephesians 6:14)**
- **Belt of Truth acquired**.
- The exit door (previously hidden) now reveals itself — made of light and stone.

---

**Lore Scroll Hidden (Optional):**
- Found in a crack behind the altar.
- Faded parchment reads:
> "Before man fell, he walked in truth. The serpent’s first weapon was not force — but speech. To restore the world, the Word must return."

---

**Items in Scene:**
- Mirror shards (5)
- Hidden scroll (1)
- “Serpent Ash” (symbolic item, carried until next scene)

---

**Exit to Scene 2: Blind Marketplace**
- After acquiring the Belt of Truth, the light-door opens and leads into a long corridor… the sounds of distant market cries echo.
- End Scene 1.
