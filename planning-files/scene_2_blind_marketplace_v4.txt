**Scene 2: The Blind Marketplace**

---

**Theme:** Spiritual blindness of society.

---

**Setting & Atmosphere:**
- A ruined city square where life continues as if nothing is wrong.
- Market stalls, shattered fountains, and broken statues line the area.
- A hazy gray light covers the sky. Two broken bell towers are visible in the distance.
- Dragons cling to people’s backs, whispering in their ears — invisible to them but visible to the player.

---

**Visual & Spiritual Tone:**
- Eerie normality. A haunting stillness under the noise.
- People act content while suffering inwardly. The player sees the weight.

**NPC 4: The Mason (Sin: Despair)**

**Location:** Sitting near the base of the broken bell tower Boaz. Surrounded by rubble and unfinished stones.

**Appearance:** Dust-covered, gray-bearded, wrapped in a heavy cloak. His dragon is nearly invisible — like a shadow clinging to his back.

**Opening Dialogue:**
> MASON: Go away. There's nothing left to build.

**Dialogue Tree:**

**Player Option 1:** "What happened here?"
> MASON: You see what happened. This tower once rang with glory. It warned us. It anchored us. Now it's just a corpse.

**Player Option 2:** "Why don’t you rebuild it?"
> MASON: For who? For what? No one hears. No one listens. Even the stones are silent now.

**Player Option 3:** "Is that really what the stones say? Or what the dragon on your back says?"
> MASON (startled): ...What did you say?

(*Dragon twitches. The player shows him the Stone of Order — an engraved stone with a divine pattern and verse.*)

**Player uses Stone of Order:**
> MASON: I... I remember this mark. I carved this once. Before the voices stopped. Before hope left.

**Player Option:** "The voices didn’t stop. You stopped listening."

(*The wind shifts. Light breaks through the clouds. His dragon, now visible, tries to tighten around him.*)

> MASON: I thought I was abandoned. But I... I abandoned the work.

(*He stands slowly. The dragon screeches and dissolves into dust.*)

> MASON: The foundation still holds. And if it holds... I can build again.

---

**Reward:** Player receives Shield of Faith

**Lore Scroll (Optional):** Hidden in a stone cavity beside the tower:
> “Faith is not the absence of ruin — it is the refusal to believe the ruin is final.”

---

**Puzzle Mechanics:**
- Requires Stone of Order (found in a lore chamber or given by Silent Child)
- Encouraging dialogue combined with item use breaks despair

---

**Spiritual Meaning:**
- Despair is the dragon of silence — it thrives on forgetting
- The work of righteousness must be continued even in ruin
- Faith is the decision to keep building, despite appearances
