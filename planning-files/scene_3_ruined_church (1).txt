**Scene 3: The Ruined Church**

---

**Theme:** Desecration of the sacred and the return of the Word

---

**Setting & Atmosphere:**
- A great cathedral in ruins, half-buried in vines and rubble
- Graffiti and false symbols cover its walls — inverted crosses, serpents crowned, mocking slogans
- Shattered stained glass, burned hymnals, broken altar
- An oppressive silence inside, as if something holy was exiled

---

**Purpose in Narrative:**
- Symbolizes the spiritual collapse of the visible Church
- A place once built on Logos, now desecrated by inversion
- The Sword of the Spirit (Word of God) is hidden here — buried and mocked, but not destroyed

---

**Puzzle: Restoring the Word**

**Visual Mechanic:**
- A shattered mural at the front of the church
- Pieces of the mural scattered throughout the building (in side rooms, crypt, tower, confessional)
- Each piece bears a line of Scripture or sacred geometry

**Steps:**
1. Explore and recover 6 mural shards
2. Place them into the frame in correct order
3. As the final shard is placed, the voice of the child (or Logos) speaks:
   > "They silenced the Word with noise. But silence remembers."

**Final Interaction:**
- The altar opens, revealing a gleaming sword embedded in a block
- Player must click and *read aloud* the full verse (optional voice mechanic or simulated selection)
   > "Take up... the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God."

**The Sword rises into their hand. Light floods the cathedral. The mocking symbols fade.**

---

**Reward:** Player receives **Sword of the Spirit (Word of God)**

**Lore Scroll (Optional):** Hidden in the confessional:
> "The Word was never gone. It was buried beneath performance, marketing, and pride. But even in silence, it lived."

---

**Spiritual Meaning:**
- Even desecrated churches retain fragments of holy ground
- The Word is not dead — it only waits for those who will lift it again

---

**Scene Transition:**
- Bells ring softly in the distance
- The player is now fully armored
- Two paths appear: one to **Boaz**, one to **Jachin**
