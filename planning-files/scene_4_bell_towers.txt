**Scene 4: The Bell Towers – Boaz & Jachin**

---

**Theme:** Justice and Righteousness restored through sacrificial obedience

---

**Setting:**
- Two ancient bell towers stand at opposite ends of the city.
- Both are partially collapsed, with corrupted vines, serpents, and rusted mechanisms.
- The towers have not rung in generations — they are the spiritual lungs of the city.

---

**Purpose:**
- Completing the player’s sacred mission of restoration.
- Each tower corresponds to a pillar of divine order from the Temple: Boaz (Justice) and Jachin (Righteousness).
- Must be reactivated through puzzles that embody their symbolic meaning.

### 🗼 Boaz – The Tower of Justice

**Atmosphere:**
- Cold, gray stone. Faded edicts line the walls. Cracked scales of judgment.

**Puzzle: The Weights of Memory**
- A great balance scale sits in the center of the tower.
- Around the tower are fragments of stories — memories from the marketplace NPCs (phrases, sins, choices).

**Steps:**
1. Gather 6 memory stones.
2. Player must place each stone on one side of the scale (Sin or Redemption).
3. The scale must balance truthfully — not just to convict, but to account for growth and repentance.
4. If done correctly, a beam of light strikes the scale.

**Final Action:**
> The player places their own “Serpent Ash” from Scene 1 on the scale.
> Only then does the tower acknowledge their right to ring the bell.

**Bell Rings:**
- A tone of deep, clarifying judgment resounds.
- Serpents all over the city hiss and retreat into shadows.

### 🗼 Jachin – The Tower of Righteousness

**Atmosphere:**
- Warm light filters through broken stained glass.
- The inside resembles a vertical chapel, with steps of trials.

**Puzzle: The Ladder of the Heart**
- A vertical climb with six symbolic stations representing virtues:
  1. Humility
  2. Purity
  3. Obedience
  4. Forgiveness
  5. Prayer
  6. Sacrifice

**At each station:**
- The player must make a symbolic choice (e.g., lay down an item, answer a scripture riddle, light a forgotten candle).
- These are internal acts — no combat, only soul reflection.

**Final Step:**
- At the top, the player finds a book stand with an open verse:
  > “The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.”
- A small bell appears. The player must ring it with reverence.

**Bell Rings:**
- A high, clear tone echoes over the city.
- Golden light floods through the broken streets.
- The dragon shrieks from the depths below.

---

**Combined Outcome:**
- The sky opens slightly. Bells ring together in harmony.
- All NPCs are briefly shown looking up, awakened.
- The player hears a distant rumbling from underground.
- A new path opens in the central square — leading into The Cavern of the King Dragon.
