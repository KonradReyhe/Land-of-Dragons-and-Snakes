**Final Scene: The Cavern of the King Dragon**

---

**Theme:** Confronting the source of lies — spiritual war and final deliverance

---

**Setting:**
- A vast, dark cavern beneath the city
- Rooted pillars and serpentine tunnels spiral toward a throne of bones and gold
- Skulls, broken relics, old symbols scattered around — trophies of inverted truth
- Faint whispering is heard constantly, like a thousand voices speaking at once

---

**Atmosphere:**
- Tense, holy dread
- Music: Low, trembling strings. Heartbeat rhythm. Then silence.

---

**Appearance of the Dragon:**
- The King Dragon is immense — a fusion of serpent, shadow, and false light
- Wears a crown of inverted symbols — cross upside down, twisted triangle, empty eye
- Speaks in a calm, articulate voice — every sentence contains truth, half-truth, and inversion

---

**Dialogue Before the Battle:**
> DRAGON: “You came to fix a broken world… But this world is mine. I whispered it into ruin.”

> PLAYER: “You lied.”

> DRAGON: “No — I offered freedom. I offered choice. They chose. Just as you are choosing now.”

> PLAYER: “They didn’t see.”

> DRAGON: “And who gave you sight?”

> (Brief pause — the player may choose: remain silent, or declare “Logos.”)

> DRAGON: “So… it returns.”

**The Final Puzzle: The Armor Activated**
Each piece of the Armor of God is required to survive the battle. The dragon attacks in six waves, each countered by a piece:

1. Deception (Counter: Belt of Truth)
2. Accusation (Counter: Breastplate of Righteousness)
3. Fear (Counter: Shield of Faith)
4. Despair (Counter: Helmet of Salvation)
5. Temptation (Counter: Shoes of the Gospel of Peace — stand and not flee)
6. Final Illusion (Counter: Sword of the Spirit)

Each wave is symbolic: visuals, whispers, memories, illusions of failure, despair, or grandeur

---

**Climax:**
- When the Sword is raised, the dragon lashes out with a blinding light and illusion of heaven
- The Silent Child appears and speaks:
  > “This is not glory. This is the mask.”

- The player cuts through the illusion
- The cavern crumbles — light pours in from above

---

**Victory:**
- The dragon is revealed as small, shriveled — the lie was always bigger than the liar
- It is cast down into the abyss
- Bells ring again above

---

**Final Moments:**
- The player walks back through the restored city
- All NPCs are different — joyful, working, praying, singing
- The temple is rebuilt

**Ending Mirror:**
- The final mirror shows the player in full armor, radiant
- Text appears:
  > “And having done all… to stand.” (Ephesians 6:13)

---

**Game Ends.**
- Fade to black
- Final screen: A glowing scroll
> “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field…” (Matthew 13:44)
