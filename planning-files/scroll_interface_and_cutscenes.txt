**📜 Scroll Reading Interface + 🎬 Cutscene Structure – Land of Dragons and Snakes**

---

## 📜 In-Game Scroll Reading Interface

**Location:** Scrolls are found throughout the game and opened via the inventory or altar events.

**UI Design:**
- Scroll unrolls from top-down in a parchment-style frame
- Background fades to dim lighting with candlelight flicker effect
- “Turn page” arrow or tap to exit
- Optional voiceover (whispered tone) for accessibility

**Font Style:**
- Script-like serif font, gold or ink-black on parchment texture
- Headings in caps (“SCROLL I – THE FIRST LIE”)

**Functionality:**
- Scrolls can be re-read from inventory at any time
- Scrolls marked as “discovered” on a parchment tracker UI
- Final Scroll is locked until all 30 are read

**Immersion Enhancer:**
- When a scroll is first discovered, a faint bell chime plays and a symbol glows briefly on screen
