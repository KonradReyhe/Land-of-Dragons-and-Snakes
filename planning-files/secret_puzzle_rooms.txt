These rooms deepen the game world spiritually and narratively. Each requires specific armor to access, rewards exploration with profound lore, and reveals mysteries not available in the main path.

### üß± Secret Room 1: The Forgotten Bellmaker‚Äôs Workshop

**Location:** Hidden chamber behind debris near Bell Tower Boaz (unlocked only with Shield of Faith)

**Theme:** Inversion of sound and the silencing of sacred patterns

**Atmosphere:**
- Dimly lit mechanical workshop with shattered bells, twisted tuning forks, and broken harmonic diagrams
- Dust motes float in shafts of cold light; faint rhythmic thudding, like a dead bell

**Puzzle: Re-Tune the Broken Bell**
- Player finds pieces of inverted bell blueprints with reversed ratios
- Must rearrange tuning rods into correct proportions (based on divine harmonic ratios: 3:4:5, golden ratio)
- Aligning them properly triggers resonance

**Reward:**
- Hidden Lore Scroll: ‚ÄúThey silenced the sound, not the structure‚Äù
- Optional item: Harmonic Tuning Crystal (allows seeing secret glyphs on walls when held)

**Spiritual Meaning:**
- Evil cannot invent ‚Äî it only distorts
- God‚Äôs pattern still exists underneath the corruption

### ‚ö∞Ô∏è Secret Room 2: The Silent Crypt

**Location:** Side path beneath the broken statue, accessible only when wearing Shoes of Peace

**Theme:** Memory of the forgotten, generational repentance

**Atmosphere:**
- Underground crypt lined with stone coffins, each with a carved face
- Whispering winds; ambient weeping sound; flickering wall torches

**Mechanic: Candle of Remembrance**
- Player must place an unlit candle on one specific tomb (based on scroll clues or dialogue hints)
- Candle lights by itself
- Spirits whisper their blessing or lament depending on prior player actions

**Reward:**
- Lore Scroll: ‚ÄúEven the buried can speak if we listen‚Äù
- Optional: Echo Pendant (vibrates when player nears forgotten truths or inversions elsewhere in world)

**Spiritual Meaning:**
- The past still speaks to the present
- Peace is not avoidance ‚Äî it is remembrance with reverence

More optional rooms can be added later (e.g. The Inverted Library, The Cloister of Veils), but these two form the foundation of the hidden world layer.
